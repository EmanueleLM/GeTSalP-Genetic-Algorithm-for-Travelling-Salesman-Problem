# GeTSalP-Genetic-Algorithm-for-Travelling-Salesman-Problem
Genetic approach to the TSP problem:

- tournament selection, ordered crossover, ordered mutation;
- random graph generator (using a module from SAAP repo*); 
- plot to evaluate the performances. 

*:the graph initialization and its managment is delegated to a module written for another project, SAAP, on my github (which refers to a security game, that's why you can find parameters as target's value and deadline)
