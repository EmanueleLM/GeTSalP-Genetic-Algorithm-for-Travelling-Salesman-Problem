# GeTSalP-Genetic-Algorithm-for-Travelling-Salesman-Problem
Genetic approach to the TSP problem

-random graph generator 

-tournament pool selection (you can manage two parameters, the number of pools and the probability assigned to each head of the pool) 

-ordered crossover and mutation 

-plot to evaluate the performances 

Please note that the graph initialization and its managment is delegated to a module written for another project, SAAP, on my github (which refers to a security game, that's why you can find parameters as target's value and deadline)
